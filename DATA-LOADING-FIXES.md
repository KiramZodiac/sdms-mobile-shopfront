# Data Loading Issues - Analysis and Fixes

## Problem Description
The website was failing to load data on the first visit but working after a refresh. This is a common issue in React applications with multiple data fetching components.

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. **Race Conditions in Data Fetching**
- Multiple components were fetching data simultaneously without coordination
- Components: `HeroBanner`, `FeaturedCategories`, `FeaturedProducts`, `PromoBanners`, `ShopImageCarousel`
- Each component had its own `useEffect` with empty dependency array, causing parallel requests

### 2. **Supabase Client Initialization Issues**
- Some components used dynamic imports for Supabase client (`useFeaturedProducts`, `usePromoBanners`, `ShopImageCarousel`)
- This caused timing issues where components tried to fetch data before the client was properly initialized

### 3. **Missing Error Boundaries and Loading States**
- Components didn't handle loading states properly
- No coordination between data fetching components
- Empty renders on first load due to missing data

### 4. **Service Worker Interference**
- Basic service worker was potentially interfering with API requests
- No proper caching strategy for API calls

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. **Centralized Data Initialization**
Created `DataInitializerProvider` component that:
- Tests Supabase connection before any data fetching
- Coordinates initialization across the app
- Provides loading states and error handling
- Prevents race conditions by ensuring connection is ready

### 2. **Improved Supabase Client**
Enhanced `src/integrations/supabase/client.ts`:
- Added connection health check with `ensureConnection()`
- Better error handling and initialization
- Connection status tracking
- Prevents multiple simultaneous connection tests

### 3. **Updated Data Fetching Hooks**
Modified all data fetching hooks to:
- Use centralized Supabase client (no more dynamic imports)
- Wait for data initialization before fetching
- Better error handling and retry logic
- Proper cleanup of abort controllers

### 4. **Enhanced Service Worker**
Updated `public/service-worker.js`:
- Network-first strategy for API requests
- Proper caching for static assets
- Better handling of different request types
- Prevents aggressive caching that could cause issues

### 5. **Component Updates**
Updated all data-fetching components:
- `FeaturedProducts`: Now waits for data initialization
- `HeroBanner`: Uses centralized client with connection checks
- `FeaturedCategories`: Added loading states and connection checks
- `ShopImageCarousel`: Improved error handling
- `usePromoBanners`: Better caching and error handling

### 6. **App-Level Loading State**
Added `AppLoader` component:
- Shows loading screen while data is initializing
- Prevents empty renders on first load
- Better user experience during initialization

## Key Changes Made

### Files Modified:
1. `src/integrations/supabase/client.ts` - Added connection management
2. `src/hooks/useFeaturedProducts.tsx` - Centralized client usage
3. `src/hooks/usePromoBanners.tsx` - Improved error handling
4. `src/components/HeroBanner.tsx` - Connection checks
5. `src/components/FeaturedCategories.tsx` - Loading states
6. `src/components/ShopImageCarousel.tsx` - Better error handling
7. `src/components/FeaturedProducts.tsx` - Data initialization checks
8. `src/App.tsx` - Added DataInitializer and AppLoader
9. `public/service-worker.js` - Improved caching strategy
10. `vite.config.ts` - Better dependency optimization

### New Files Created:
1. `src/components/DataInitializer.tsx` - Centralized data initialization
2. `src/components/AppLoader.tsx` - Loading screen component

## Testing the Fixes

### Before Fixes:
- First visit: Empty components, no data loaded
- After refresh: Data loads correctly
- Console errors about failed requests

### After Fixes:
- First visit: Loading screen, then data loads correctly
- Consistent data loading behavior
- Better error handling and user feedback
- No more race conditions

## Performance Improvements

1. **Reduced Bundle Size**: Better code splitting and dependency optimization
2. **Faster Initial Load**: Coordinated data fetching prevents redundant requests
3. **Better Caching**: Improved service worker strategy
4. **Error Recovery**: Better error handling and retry logic

## Monitoring and Debugging

The fixes include better logging:
- Connection status in console
- Data initialization progress
- Error details for debugging
- Request/response tracking

## Future Recommendations

1. **Implement React Query**: Consider using React Query for better data management
2. **Add Retry Logic**: Implement exponential backoff for failed requests
3. **Optimistic Updates**: Add optimistic UI updates for better UX
4. **Error Boundaries**: Add more granular error boundaries
5. **Performance Monitoring**: Add performance tracking for data loading

## Conclusion

The implemented fixes address the core issues causing data loading failures on first visit:
- Eliminated race conditions through centralized initialization
- Improved error handling and user feedback
- Better caching strategy
- Consistent data loading behavior

The website should now load data correctly on the first visit without requiring a refresh.
