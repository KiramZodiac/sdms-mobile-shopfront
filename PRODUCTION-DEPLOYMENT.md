# 🚀 Production Deployment Guide - SDM Electronics

## ✅ Pre-Deployment Checklist

### 🔐 Security Configuration
- [x] **Security Headers Added** - CSP, XSS Protection, CSRF protection via `vercel.json`
- [x] **Storage Policies Secured** - Created secure admin-only upload policies
- [x] **Console Logs Removed** - All production console logs are conditional
- [x] **Environment Variables** - All sensitive data in environment variables

### 🏗️ Build Optimization  
- [x] **Vite Production Config** - Terser minification, chunk splitting, tree shaking
- [x] **Bundle Analysis** - Manual chunks for vendor, UI, Supabase, analytics
- [x] **Asset Optimization** - Static asset caching headers
- [x] **PWA Optimization** - Service worker caching for Supabase API calls

### 📱 PWA & Performance
- [x] **Service Worker** - Auto-update registration with network-first caching
- [x] **Web Manifest** - Complete PWA manifest with proper icons
- [x] **Meta Tags** - Fixed duplicate tags, proper OG/Twitter cards
- [x] **Performance Monitoring** - Vercel Analytics & Speed Insights integrated

### 🗄️ Database & Storage
- [x] **Migration Review** - All migrations safe for production
- [x] **RLS Policies** - Row Level Security policies implemented
- [x] **Storage Security** - Admin-only upload/modify, public read access
- [x] **Data Validation** - Proper constraints and validations

## 🔧 Environment Variables Required

```bash
# Supabase Configuration
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key

# Payment Gateway
VITE_FLUTTERWAVE_PUBLIC_KEY=your_flutterwave_public_key

# OpenAI (for product image analysis)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### 1. Pre-deployment Database Update
```bash
# Run the secure storage migration
supabase db push

# Or manually apply the new migration:
supabase migration up --include-all
```

### 2. Environment Setup
```bash
# In your deployment platform (Vercel/Netlify):
# 1. Set all environment variables from .env.example
# 2. Ensure NODE_ENV=production
# 3. Configure build command: npm run build
# 4. Configure output directory: dist
```

### 3. Build and Deploy
```bash
# Local test build
npm run build
npm run preview

# Deploy to production
git push origin main  # (triggers automatic deployment)
```

## 🔍 Post-Deployment Verification

### Security Tests
- [ ] Test CSP headers with browser dev tools
- [ ] Verify storage upload requires admin authentication  
- [ ] Check no console logs in production build
- [ ] Verify HTTPS redirection

### Performance Tests  
- [ ] Run Lighthouse audit (target: 90+ scores)
- [ ] Test PWA installation on mobile
- [ ] Verify service worker caching
- [ ] Check bundle sizes are optimized

### Functionality Tests
- [ ] Test all product CRUD operations (admin only)
- [ ] Verify payment flow with Flutterwave
- [ ] Test image uploads (admin authentication required)
- [ ] Verify email notifications work
- [ ] Test mobile responsiveness

## ⚠️ Critical Security Notes

### 🚨 IMPORTANT: Apply Security Migration
**You MUST run the new migration `20250126000000-secure-storage-policies.sql` before production deployment.**

The previous storage configuration allowed public upload/delete access, which is extremely dangerous. The new migration:
- ✅ Restricts uploads/modifications to authenticated admin users only
- ✅ Maintains public read access for product/category images  
- ✅ Implements proper RLS policies

### 🔒 Admin Authentication
- Admin users must be properly configured in `admin_users` table
- Use strong passwords and enable MFA if available
- Regularly audit admin access logs

### 📊 Monitoring Setup
- Monitor error rates via Vercel Analytics
- Set up alerts for high error rates or performance degradation
- Regularly check Supabase logs for suspicious activity

## 🛠️ Performance Optimizations Applied

### Bundle Splitting
- **Vendor chunk**: React, React-DOM, React-Router
- **UI chunk**: Radix UI components  
- **Supabase chunk**: Database client
- **Analytics chunk**: Vercel monitoring tools

### Caching Strategy
- **Static assets**: 1 year cache with immutable flag
- **Service worker**: No cache, must revalidate
- **API calls**: Network-first with 1-year fallback cache

### Build Optimizations
- Terser minification with console.log removal
- Tree shaking for unused code elimination  
- Conditional development-only code
- Compressed asset serving

## 📞 Support & Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
- [ ] Monitor performance metrics weekly
- [ ] Update dependencies monthly  
- [ ] Review security logs weekly
- [ ] Backup database weekly
- [ ] Test disaster recovery quarterly

### Emergency Contacts
- **Database Issues**: Check Supabase dashboard
- **Payment Issues**: Flutterwave support
- **Hosting Issues**: Vercel support dashboard
